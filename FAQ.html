<p>PyTables is a package for managing hierarchical datasets designed to
efficiently cope with extremely large amounts of data.</p>
<p>It is built on top of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">HDF5</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id4">[1]</a>  library, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">Python language</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id19" id="id20">[2]</a> and the
<a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.scipy.org">NumPy</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id21" id="id22">[3]</a> package.
It features an object-oriented interface that, combined with C extensions
for the performance-critical parts of the code, makes it a fast yet
extremely easy-to-use tool for interactively storing and retrieving very
large amounts of data.</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Python is interactive.</p>
<p>People familiar with data processing understand how powerful command line
interfaces are for exploring mathematical relationships and scientific data
sets.
Python provides an interactive environment with the added benefit of a full
featured programming language behind it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Python is productive for beginners and experts alike.</p>
<p>PyTables is targeted at engineers, scientists, system analysts, financial
analysts, and others who consider programming a necessary evil.
Any time spent learning a language or tracking down bugs is time spent not
solving their real problem.
Python has a short learning curve and most people can do real and useful
work with it in a day of learning.
Its clean syntax and interactive nature facilitate this.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Python is data-handling friendly.</p>
<p>Python comes with nice idioms that make the access to data much easier:
general slicing (i.e. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">data[start:stop:step]</span></tt>), list comprehensions,
iterators, generators ... are constructs that make the interaction with
your data very easy.</p>

<div class="section" id="is-pytables-safe">
<h3>Is PyTables safe?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-pytables-safe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Well, first of all, let me state that PyTables does not support transactional
features yet (we don&#8217;t even know if we will ever be motivated to implement
this!), so there is always the risk that you can lose your data in case of an
unexpected event while writing (like a power outage, system shutdowns ...).
Having said that, if your typical scenarios are <em>write once, read many</em>, then
the use of !PyTables is perfectly safe, even for dealing extremely large
amounts of data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-pytables-be-used-in-concurrent-access-scenarios">
<h3>Can PyTables be used in concurrent access scenarios?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-pytables-be-used-in-concurrent-access-scenarios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It depends. Concurrent reads are no problem at all. However, whenever a process
(or thread) is trying to write, then problems will start to appear.
First, PyTables doesn&#8217;t support locking at any level, so several process
writing concurrently to the same !PyTables file will probably end corrupting
it, so don&#8217;t do this!
Even having only one process writing and the others reading is a hairy thing,
because the reading processes might be reading incomplete data from a
concurrent data writing operation.</p>
<p>The solution would be to lock the file while writing and unlock it after a
flush over the file has been performed.
Also, in order to avoid cache (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">HDF5</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id6">[1]</a>, PyTables) problems with read apps, you
would need to re-open your files whenever you are going to issue a read
operation.
If a re-opening operation is unacceptable in terms of speed, you may want to
do all your I/O operations in one single process (or thread) and communicate
the results via sockets, <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Queue.Queue</span></tt> objects (in case of using
threads) or whatever, with the client process/thread.</p>

<h3>What kind of containers does PyTables implement?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-kind-of-containers-does-pytables-implement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>PyTables does support a series of data containers that address specific needs

<div class="section" id="is-pytables-a-replacement-for-a-relational-database">
<h3>Is PyTables a replacement for a relational database?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-pytables-a-replacement-for-a-relational-database" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>No, by no means. PyTables lacks many features that are standard in most
relational databases.
In particular, it does not have support for relationships (beyond the
hierarchical one, of course) between datasets and it does not have
transactional features.
PyTables is more focused on speed and dealing with really large datasets, than
implementing the above features.
In that sense, PyTables can be best viewed as a <em>teammate</em> of a relational
database.</p>
<p>For example, if you have very large tables in your existing relational
database, they will take lots of space on disk, potentially reducing the
performance of the relational engine.
In such a case, you can move those huge tables out of your existing relational
database to PyTables, and let your relational engine do what it does best (i.e.
manage relatively small or medium datasets with potentially complex
relationships), and use PyTables for what it has been designed for (i.e. manage
large amounts of data which are loosely related).</p>

<h3>How can PyTables be fast if it is written in an interpreted language like Python?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-can-pytables-be-fast-if-it-is-written-in-an-interpreted-language-like-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Actually, all of the critical I/O code in !PyTables is a thin layer of code on
top of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">HDF5</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id8">[1]</a>, which is a very efficient C library. <a class="reference external" href="http://cython.org">Cython</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id42" id="id43">[9]</a> is used as the
<em>glue</em> language to generate &#8220;wrappers&#8221; around HDF5 calls so that they can be
used in Python.
Also, the use of an efficient numerical package such as <a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.scipy.org">NumPy</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id21" id="id24">[3]</a> makes the most
costly operations effectively run at C speed.
Finally, time-critical loops are usually implemented in <a class="reference external" href="http://cython.org">Cython</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id42" id="id44">[9]</a> (which, if
used properly, allows to generate code that runs at almost pure C speeds).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="if-it-is-designed-to-deal-with-very-large-datasets-then-pytables-should-consume-a-lot-of-memory-shouldn-t-it">
<h3>If it is designed to deal with very large datasets, then PyTables should consume a lot of memory, shouldn&#8217;t it?<a class="headerlink" href="#if-it-is-designed-to-deal-with-very-large-datasets-then-pytables-should-consume-a-lot-of-memory-shouldn-t-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Well, you already know that PyTables sits on top of HDF5, Python and <a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.scipy.org">NumPy</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id21" id="id25">[3]</a>,
and if we add its own logic (~7500 lines of code in Python, ~3000 in Cython
and ~4000 in C), then we should conclude that PyTables isn&#8217;t effectively a
paradigm of lightness.</p>
<p>Having said that, PyTables (as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">HDF5</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id9">[1]</a> itself) tries very hard to optimize the
memory consumption by implementing a series of features like dynamic
determination of buffer sizes, <em>Least Recently Used</em> cache for keeping unused
nodes out of memory, and extensive use of compact <a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.scipy.org">NumPy</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id21" id="id26">[3]</a> data containers.
Moreover, PyTables is in a relatively mature state and most memory leaks have
been already addressed and fixed.</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea of what you can expect, a PyTables program can deal
with a table with around 30 columns and 1 million entries using as low as 13 MB
of memory (on a 32-bit platform).
All in all, it is not that much, is it?.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-was-pytables-born">
<h3>Why was PyTables born?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-was-pytables-born" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Because, back in August 2002, one of its authors (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pytables.org/moin/FrancescAlted">Francesc Alted</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id45" id="id46">[10]</a>) had a
need to save lots of hierarchical data in an efficient way for later
post-processing it.
After trying out several approaches, he found that they presented distinct
inconveniences.
For example, working with file sizes larger than, say, 100 MB, was rather
painful with ZODB (it took lots of memory with the version available by that
time).</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf">netCDF3</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id47" id="id48">[11]</a> interface provided by <a class="reference external" href="http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/scientificpython">Scientific Python</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id51" id="id52">[12]</a> was great, but it did
not allow to structure the hierarchically; besides, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf">netCDF3</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id47" id="id49">[11]</a> only supports
homogeneous datasets, not heterogeneous ones (i.e. tables). (As an aside,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf">netCDF4</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id47" id="id53">[11]</a> overcomes many of the limitations of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf">netCDF3</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id47" id="id50">[11]</a>, although curiously
enough, it is based on top of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">HDF5</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id10">[1]</a>, the library chosen as the base for
PyTables from the very beginning.)</p>
<p>So, he decided to give <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">HDF5</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id11">[1]</a> a try, start doing his own wrappings to it and
voilà, this is how the first public release of PyTables (0.1) saw the light
in October 2002, three months after his itch started to eat him ;-).</p>

<h3>How does PyTables compare with the h5py project?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-pytables-compare-with-the-h5py-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Well, they are similar in that both packages are Python interfaces to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">HDF5</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id12">[1]</a>
library, but there are some important differences to be noted.
<a class="reference external" href="http://h5py.alfven.org">h5py</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id61" id="id62">[16]</a> is an attempt to map the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">HDF5</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id13">[1]</a> feature set to <a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.scipy.org">NumPy</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id21" id="id27">[3]</a> as closely as
possible.
In addition, it also provides access to nearly all of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">HDF5</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id14">[1]</a> C API.</p>
<p>Instead, PyTables builds up an additional abstraction layer on top of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">HDF5</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id15">[1]</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.scipy.org">NumPy</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id21" id="id28">[3]</a> where it implements things like an enhanced type system, an
<a class="reference internal" href="usersguide/optimization.html#searchoptim"><em>engine for enabling complex queries</em></a>, an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pytables.org/moin/ComputingKernel">efficient
computational kernel</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id63" id="id64">[17]</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pytables.org/moin/PyTablesPro">advanced indexing capabilities</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id65" id="id66">[18]</a> or an undo/redo
feature, to name just a few.
This additional layer also allows PyTables to be relatively independent of its
underlying libraries (and their possible limitations).
For example, PyTables can support <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">HDF5</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id16">[1]</a> data types like <cite>enumerated</cite> or <cite>time</cite>
that are available in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">HDF5</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id17">[1]</a> library but not in the <a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.scipy.org">NumPy</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id21" id="id29">[3]</a> package; or even
perform powerful complex queries that are not implemented directly in neither
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">HDF5</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id18">[1]</a> nor <a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.scipy.org">NumPy</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id21" id="id30">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, PyTables also tries hard to be a high performance interface to
HDF5/NumPy, implementing niceties like internal LRU caches for nodes and other

<p>Sure.  However, you should first check out the <a class="reference internal" href="MIGRATING_TO_2.x.html"><em>Migrating from PyTables 1.x to 2.x</em></a>

It should provide hints to the most frequently asked questions on this regard.</p>

<div class="section" id="for-combined-searches-like-table-where-x-5-x-3-why-was-a-operator-chosen-instead-of-an-and">
<h3>For combined searches like <cite>table.where(&#8216;(x&lt;5) &amp; (x&gt;3)&#8217;)</cite>, why was a <cite>&amp;</cite> operator chosen instead of an <cite>and</cite>?<a class="headerlink" href="#for-combined-searches-like-table-where-x-5-x-3-why-was-a-operator-chosen-instead-of-an-and" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Search expressions are in fact Python expressions written as strings, and they
are evaluated as such.
This has the advantage of not having to learn a new syntax, but it also
implies some limitations with logical <cite>and</cite> and <cite>or</cite> operators, namely that
they can not be overloaded in Python.
Thus, it is impossible right now to get an element-wise operation out of an
expression like <cite>&#8216;array1 and array2&#8217;</cite>.
That&#8217;s why one has to choose some other operator, being <cite>&amp;</cite> and <cite>|</cite> the most
similar to their C counterparts <cite>&amp;&amp;</cite> and <cite>||</cite>, which aren&#8217;t available in
Python either.</p>
<p>You should be careful about expressions like <cite>&#8216;x&lt;5 &amp; x&gt;3&#8217;</cite> and others like
<cite>&#8216;3 &lt; x &lt; 5&#8217;</cite> which &#8216;&#8217;won&#8217;t work as expected&#8217;&#8216;, because of the different
operator precedence and the absence of an overloaded logical <cite>and</cite> operator.
More on this in the appendix about condition syntax in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/RM_H5T.html">HDF5 manual</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id83" id="id84">[26]</a>.</p>
<p>There are quite a few packages affected by those limitations including <a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.scipy.org">NumPy</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id21" id="id31">[3]</a>
themselves and <a class="reference external" href="http://sqlobject.org">SQLObject</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id85" id="id86">[27]</a>, and there have been quite longish discussions about
adding the possibility of overloading logical operators to Python (see
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0335">PEP 335</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id87" id="id88">[28]</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2004-September/048763.html">this thread</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id92" id="id93">[30]</a> for more details).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-can-not-select-rows-using-in-kernel-queries-with-a-condition-that-involves-an-uint64col-why">
<h3>I can not select rows using in-kernel queries with a condition that involves an UInt64Col. Why?<a class="headerlink" href="#i-can-not-select-rows-using-in-kernel-queries-with-a-condition-that-involves-an-uint64col-why" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This turns out to be a limitation of the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/numexpr">numexpr</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id73" id="id75">[22]</a> package.
Internally, <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/numexpr">numexpr</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id73" id="id76">[22]</a> uses a limited set of types for doing calculations, and
unsigned integers are always upcasted to the immediate signed integer that
can fit the information.
The problem here is that there is not a (standard) signed integer that can be
used to keep the information of a 64-bit unsigned integer.</p>
<p>So, your best bet right now is to avoid <cite>uint64</cite> types if you can.
If you absolutely need <cite>uint64</cite>, the only way for doing selections with this
is through regular Python selections.
For example, if your table has a <cite>colM</cite> column which is declared as an
<cite>UInt64Col</cite>, then you can still filter its values with:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">row</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;colN&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">table</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">row</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;colM&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">X</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>However, this approach will generally lead to slow speed (specially on Win32
platforms, where the values will be converted to Python <cite>long</cite> values).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-m-already-using-pytables-2-x-but-i-m-still-getting-numarray-objects-instead-of-numpy-ones">
<h3>I&#8217;m already using PyTables 2.x but I&#8217;m still getting numarray objects instead of NumPy ones!<a class="headerlink" href="#i-m-already-using-pytables-2-x-but-i-m-still-getting-numarray-objects-instead-of-numpy-ones" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is most probably due to the fact that you are using a file created with
PyTables 1.x series.
By default, PyTables 1.x was setting an HDF5 attribute <cite>FLAVOR</cite> with the value
<cite>&#8216;numarray&#8217;</cite> to all leaves.
Now, PyTables 2.x sees this attribute and obediently converts the internal
object (truly a NumPy object) into a <cite>numarray</cite> one.
For PyTables 2.x files the <cite>FLAVOR</cite> attribute will only be saved when
explicitly set via the <cite>leaf.flavor</cite> property (or when passing data to an
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Array</span></tt> or <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Table</span></tt> at creation time), so you will be able to
distinguish default flavors from user-set ones by checking the existence of
the <cite>FLAVOR</cite> attribute.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you don&#8217;t want to receive <cite>numarray</cite> objects when reading old
files, you have several possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Remove the flavor for your datasets by hand:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">leaf</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">h5file</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">walkNodes</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">classname</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;Leaf&#39;</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">leaf</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">flavor</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Use the :program:&#8217;ptrepack` utility with the flag <em class="xref std std-option">--upgrade-flavors</em>
so as to convert all flavors in old files to the default (effectively by
removing the <cite>FLAVOR</cite> attribute).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Remove the <cite>numarray</cite> (and/or <cite>Numeric</cite>) package from your system.
Then PyTables 2.x will return you pure !NumPy objects (it can&#8217;t be
otherwise!).</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>This problem can be due to a series of reasons, but the most probable one is
that you have a version of a DLL library that is needed by PyTables and it is
not at the correct version.
Please, double-check the versions of the required libraries for PyTables and
install newer versions, if needed. In most cases, this solves the issue.</p>
<p>In case you continue getting problems, there are situations where other
programs do install libraries in the PATH that are <strong>optional</strong> to PyTables
(for example BZIP2 or LZO), but that they will be used if they are found in
your system (i.e. anywhere in your <span class="target" id="index-0"></span><tt class="xref std std-envvar docutils literal"><span class="pre">PATH</span></tt>).
So, if you find any of these libraries in your PATH, upgrade it to the latest
